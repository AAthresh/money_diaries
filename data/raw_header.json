I am extremely privileged that my parents made it a priority to create and contribute to a college fund for me, which had accumulated about $35,000 by the time I started college. I also entered college with nearly a year's worth of AP and Dual Enrollment credits and was able to graduate in three years. Throughout those three years, I worked and paid half of my rent while my dad sent me money to cover the other half, as well as groceries.

Fortunately, we were poor and my grades were good so my undergrad was fully covered by financial aid (grants, scholarships, part-time work).

Initially, I felt like I missed out on the college experience during my first two years by being an anti-social nerd, but in hindsight, I used the money the best way possible. That boost set me up for life and I feel it was based on luck to some extent.

My parents are aging and did not properly save for their own retirement, and the expectation in our culture is for the children to be responsible for the parents. I may also want to have children and am saving for my own retirement so as not to burden my children with my care, thus I often worry about how I can be financially prepared to support three generations at once. In the short term, I'm aggressively saving up for a 20% downpayment on a home, but that doesn't seem feasible any time soon. I'm also planning a career shift that will take a 40% pay cut (to start). Don't get me wrong, I'm scared, but I also have regretted not making that career change for the past five years. It's something I need to get out of my system before I get older since it is a highly physical job. I will follow it as far as I can, knowing I can fall back on my current career.

Now that we make a good amount of money, he is always wanting to purchase the newest Apple products or expensive clothing. We both are working on meeting somewhere in the middle of our two extremes.

However, it has become more common in the Ultra Orthodox community (which I am still part of culturally and socially, but not in practice), and has become a lot more accepted, especially since there are gender-segregated college programs that specifically cater to members of the community. Because I was initially dissuaded from going to college, I applied to college so late in the year that I had to apply to a direct admissions program and didn't have the opportunity to apply for scholarships. To pay for school, I worked full-time while taking classes for about four-and-a-half years. During that time, I had it drilled in my mind that student loans were a no-no (my parents had taken out students loans that they struggled to repay for most of my life), so I put my tuition on credit cards or paid in cash. Using balance transfers on 0% intro APR cards, I mostly managed to avoid interest.

I considered us to be extremely poor, despite being middle class, and had a lot of resentment towards my parents for not being able to give me what my friends had. I grew up in a very materialistic community where designer strollers and handbags and vacation homes in the Catskills were the norm.

When I was in high school, it was taught like a religion that what your degree was in didn't matter. If you had a Bachelor's, you were guaranteed upward mobility. So I did what a lot of us did \u2014 I took out tens of thousands of dollars in student loans with literally no understanding of what that meant. None of it felt real and I felt promised that I would have the resources to handle the debt after school. I worked part-time jobs through college but it was pocket change compared to the tuition and living expenses that were largely covered by loans and grants.", "Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?": "I was raised by my mom who had a very laissez-faire approach to money. As a small business owner, money was sporadic and unpredictable, and she would tell me \"there will always be debt, so enjoy your money while you can.\" This mentality meant we were periodically homeless, often bouncing around and staying wherever we could. Money was not \"real\" and financial stability was, uh, not a thing. She did the best she could and I have the absolute utmost respect for single parents, but her lack of awareness or education about money meant that we often didn't know where our next meal would come from (or somedays, if it would come at all), which also contributed to my toxic and insecure relationship with food.", "What was your first job and why did you get it?": "I started working two jobs at 16. I worked 20 hours a week editing my college newspaper (I was attending community college as part of a program offered by my state while concurrently attending high school) and about 15 hours at a clothing store in the mall.

One of my very first memories was of being evicted from the room we rented and moving into the car. This happened a lot and my mom always tried to make a \"camping adventure\" out of it but I knew what was going on. Seeing not only our horrific financial situation but also my mom's incredibly irresponsible spending habits was super formative and one of the reasons I'm so weird and uptight about money now.", "Do you worry about money now?": "I worry about everything, but I've put enough of a buffer between myself and destitution over the course of my twenties that my worries are less intense but still there. I used to have recurring nightmares about becoming homeless again, but getting out of debt and having a decent amount in savings keeps the fear at bay. Plus my car. You're never truly homeless when you have a car.", "At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?": "I became financially responsible for myself at 16, though I was still living with my grandparents at the time. Making my own money and the freedom that came with that really demystified the idea of money for me. As a child, money felt very magical: some people had it and some people didn't (we were the ones that didn't). Making my own money helped me to realize that no, actually, it wasn't some unattainable thing. It would be many, many years before I would claw myself out of debt and develop good financial habits, as most of my twenties were truly spent undoing the damage of childhood poverty and the poverty mindset. A lot of people don't realize that \"growing up poor\" means that not only are you starting from zero (or starting your adult life with debt), you are actively having to undo a lot of early problems. For example, I had my first tooth pulled at 19 because I couldn't afford to fix it and never went to the dentist or doctor as a child. Things like that.", "Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.": "I did inherit $10,000 when I was 21 after a relative passed away.

The pain of her loss made me decide I needed to do something major to shake myself out of the sadness and monotony I felt with my life.

My first Money Diary gave me some shocking insight into how I was spending recklessly and also made me realize my toxic and unhealthy relationship with food. I took the feedback from the diary and started looking into my eating disorder (I had no idea I had an eating disorder before my Money Diary but that's EXACTLY what I have), and I made the decision to get weight loss surgery, which I got three weeks prior to this diary.

My parents started saving for my college before I was born, so they were able to pay for my tuition and support me through college. Thankfully I never had to take loans out in undergrad because I relied entirely on federal loans for law school. My amazing parents were still able to help me stay afloat during law school because I wasn't making any money, but they told me if I wanted to go to law school that was my financial burden to bare.

Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?": "I don't remember too many conversations about money growing up. My mom is definitely better with finances than my dad, so she always tried to teach me the importance of money and how to handle it. She would give me and my siblings little weekly allowances that she would encourage us to save for a time when there was something we really wanted to buy.

I think my comfortable upbringing has given me some bad spending habits that I still carry with me even though my salary does not necessarily always allow for it. I don't have credit card debt, but my savings always takes the hit. What worries me most is my student loans. I'm on year one of a ten-year track for Public Interest Loan Forgiveness, and as long as I make minimum payments on my loans for ten years while working for a non-profit or the government, the balance will be forgiven. But I'm nervous that the program will go away before the tenth year comes, or some other unforeseeable thing happens and I'm stuck with hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay back on my public interest salary. I've spoken with representatives from my loan management company who have told me the requirements and I've done lots of research and filled out the necessary forms, so fingers crossed it all goes accordingly.", "At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?": "I didn't become financially responsible until after I took the bar exam and started a paid internship, so I was 26. I didn't have a paying job or internship at all in law school because they were all with the government, so my parents helped me pay for some everyday necessities.

Once I graduated, I was able to continue my education at that same college for a fraction of what a university would have cost. I graduated in April of 2020 with my associates degree in nursing.

After that point, my mom took over the finances and went into business for herself. She struggled at first because she did not speak English fluently, but she is the strongest person I know and made her business flourish. We still struggled financially throughout high school and college but my mom kept things stable, even as my dad continued to wreak havoc with his various issues. She is now a homeowner and owns two businesses. I think due to the loss of control she felt from my dad making bad business decisions and doing things like using rent money to gamble, she became very controlling with money.

He brought me into his office one day and told me I tried really hard but maybe I should look for a different job and gave me the rest of that week's pay.", "Did you worry about money growing up?": "Yes, I saw my parents fight about money constantly. My mom would stress about money and paying bills all the time. When we would go grocery shopping, she would only buy things on sale and was acutely aware of every penny spent.

I knew I had to get a scholarship for college at an early age so that also weighed on my mind a lot. My parents separated several times throughout middle and high school and my dad never paid child support during those times. My mom moved us into the industrial outskirts of a wealthy town so that we could attend a good school system but the house was in rough shape. During high school, I didn't have a regular bedroom because I wanted my brother and mom to have the bedrooms. I slept in a hallway corridor in the back of the house that we walled off with plywood.

We are prioritizing saving money and building up our retirement funds. We feel both incredibly lucky and guilty that we have not been negatively impacted by COVID-19, as we are both in pretty secure jobs that can WFH. However, seeing what has happened to our economy this year has made us feel like we need to squirrel away as much money as we can right now. My financial stress has ramped up in the past few months after seeing how COVID-19 has ravaged my mom's business. She is close to retirement age and was planning to sell her very profitable business as part of her retirement plan. Now things are up in the air and she is devastated and rightfully so. I always knew that I would be helping my parents financially at some point in their retirement but it might be sooner rather than later. Who knows what the future will bring.

Although my mom stopped speaking to me for a year when I left the PharmD program, we eventually made amends and she continued to give me financial support for housing throughout the rest of my time in college. I lived with her for a bit after school and helped pay her mortgage. When I turned 26, I moved to California from the east coast and feel that I was able to make such a big life change because I knew that I could fall back on my mom if any financial emergencies came up.

I got it because I didn't come from a family with a lot of money and my father had recently died meaning we would have even less.

I worry about taking on an unnecessary expense and then finding myself losing income or incurring an extra expense that makes it hard for me to live. Another source of stress is the fact that since I was in college, my mom would regularly demand money from me and I would be so confused about how she thought that I, a person in their 20s who hadn't been working long and didn't have a good job, could potentially have enough money to give her, a person who has been working her whole life and graduated into a better economy.", "At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?": "I moved out at 24, so I guess that's the age I became financially responsible for myself?

To summarize post-high school: I began med school in my late teens (seven-year program; no need for prior undergrad degree in my home country), which required student loans, then internship (grueling, miserable, but at least I had a paycheck and could start repaying loans), then matched to a residency program in the U.S. (finally a livable salary!), and three years later began fellowship training. By the time I landed my first real job here (as a board-certified subspecialist physician) and got my first real salary (six figures) in my early thirties, all student loans and car loan were fully paid, and I was officially debt-free. Financially, I might be in a somewhat better position than the average U.S. physician my age, mainly because med school was cheaper in my native country than it is here and I was able to immigrate to the U.S. (a whole other struggle in itself).

One concept my dad did instill in me is while money should be spent, it should never be wasted. We had a very nice house but bought clothes at Costco or Target. Food was never wasted and we didn't eat out often when I was young. The luxury cars my parents drove were used for 20+ years. Lavish items like fancy clothes or jewelry weren't prized in my family, and I mainly spent money on books and movies. My parents spent heavily on experiences. We had memberships to most of the museums in Chicago, as well as season passes to a local theater. We traveled at least once a year, usually international. I valued experiences over material goods at an early age.", "Do you worry about money now?": "Because of my relationship with my wonderful husband, H., I am far more aware of money now. H.. came from a lower middle class background and didn't have half the financial privilege I enjoyed. When we got married we shared his remaining $60,000 of school debt and paid it off together. It was the first time I had to manage debt.

I am far more interested in finances since starting my new family and pay very close attention to our budget and investments.", "At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?": "This is embarrassing. I focused on getting my master's in a field that makes almost no money, at least in the beginning, so my parents supported me for a lot longer than is normal. I became entirely financially responsible for myself at 29. However, out of all the women in my generation in my extended family, my sister and I are the only ones who became financially independent. Whether or not I have a financial safety net is a sticky question. For now, yes, there is no question I have an ample safety net from my mother who is quite wealthy.

My dad also started a Roth IRA for me when I was young which is worth $67,000. He very much wanted us to have a solid foundation for retirement even before we established ourselves as working adults. We had issues a year before he passed because I wanted to take control of my UTMA account, not to use the money but to begin independently investing. It was clear this account came with strings attached and even though I was legally meant to take over the account at 18 he wanted to stay in charge and control my financial planning. Before he died, he did eventually allow me to control my account. H. and I have kept everything he's built for us as the bulk of our retirement savings. In the next few years, I hope to substantially build that up on my own through my earnings.

It was 100% expected of me, especially because I was so good at school. Though my mom went to college, she ended up as a house cleaner, and there was always an unspoken shame surrounding her job and an expectation that my sister and I would have \"real careers.\" Ironically (or perhaps not?), I ended up in a very similar line of work that doesn't require a degree (sister too), but I love my work, and my bachelor's in horticulture has been invaluable to what I do. My tuition was covered by scholarships.

Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?": "Though I don't remember specific lessons, I was essentially taught by my mother through observing her actions and very loud opinions to always save my money. My mother constantly talked (usually negatively) about other people's/families' spending choices and she viewed everything through the lens of monetary value and financial consequences. Her tight grip on money and careful spending was a constant stressor and presence. I learned from a young age that asking for anything that required money (material objects, opportunities, etc) was a huge trigger for my mother so I never asked for any money and learned how to make it myself. I picked up frugality (and major financial stress) from a young age. I constantly check myself in judging other people's financial choices and placing value on things in monetary terms alone.", "What was your first job and why did you get it?": "I started babysitting around 12 to have some cash and because as soon as I could be trusted alone (and apparently with other children), I was left to my own devices and needed something to do. I did that, as well as working as an under the table counselor-in-training until I got my first taxed job at 14 at a mini-golf place. I've worked ever since.", "Did you worry about money growing up?": "Yes, I always worried about money. Modeling my behavior after my mother from a pretty young age, I didn't like spending money because I never knew if I'd need it in the future. I felt guilty for the normal everyday expenses I burdened her with (clothing, food) because my mother was very open about her money-related stress. It's not like there wasn't enough money to feed or house us, and my mom owned (mortgaged) the home we lived in, but the stress of never having quite enough was always there.", "Do you worry about money now?": "All the time. I am constantly doing math in my head related to our finances and always save as much as I can. My husband and I don't go out to dinner or bars, we have never been on vacation in the ten years we've been together, and we don't buy much more than we need. If we make a larger purchase, it's going to be something that we'll have forever. I price check smaller purchases we make across multiple websites and buy most essentials in bulk to save money in the long run, but it's also probably another scarcity mindset coping mechanism. I've been avoiding Amazon, and it's killing me knowing we are purposely spending slightly more at other places. But being so frugal (as well inheriting a sizable sum of money) has led to being able to afford to buy land (mortgaged) that we will soon build on. Building and owning a house has always been our ultimate goal \u2014 we both have hard nesting and homebody tendencies. Even so, parting with the money we'll be putting down for the construction loan, not knowing what our future holds, is terrifying. While at the moment we are in a really great financial place and are about to embark on the super exciting major milestone of building our forever home, I'm terrified by the idea that we are in professions without a whole lot of upward movement and our income won't keep up with inflation. Finances are the scariest unknown when I think of the future.", "At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?": "I became financially responsible for myself as soon as I turned 18. I lived in my mother's house until I went to college (a few months later) but never moved back in and was responsible for almost all my own bills and expenses (the only exception being my cell phone; I stayed on the family phone plan until I was 22 when my then-boyfriend and I upgraded to iPhones and got our own plan). My husband and I have a pretty hefty safety net in our own savings, but in the next few months, we'll be putting it all down for our construction loan.

We used to walk around the mall food court as a family just to get free samples and avoid paying for a full lunch. In contrast, when I would spend summers with my mother, we were dirt poor, but always had food on the table. My mom had two more kids after my siblings and me, so five kids in a two-bedroom house would often overwhelm her. She was also mentally unstable and would lash out at us about not having enough money. I grew up feeling super guilty about my existence.

I stopped trippin' about that early on in adulthood after years of therapy though.", "Do you worry about money now?": "Not anymore. I used to when I was working retail after I graduated from college.

She didn't pressure or coach me to do any of it (in fact, she really hates talking about money/budgeting or anything to do with financial planning), but I'm a competitive person by nature and wanted to match her financially. I became really strict with my budget while also leveling up my salary. Within three years I was able to pay off $18,000 worth of student loans and $7,000 of credit card debt. She didn't help me with any of it, but she was fine with the standard of living I was setting for us when I was on a shoestring budget. Since hitting some of my financial milestones, I've eased up considerably on my budget. I try to keep my monthly expenses as low as possible and be a little freer with my everyday spending.

When I decided to take a gap year between my sophomore and junior year to qualify for the in-state tuition rate, I realized how hard it was to live without loan assistance. I was working retail part-time and couldn't get any more than 20 hours a week. I was receiving food stamps and hit up the food bank every chance I could, but I was still scared I wasn't going to make rent for the month. I did stupid things like flip points of MDMA or steal laundry detergent from big corporations to subsidize the lack of cash flow. Petty stuff, but still, I recognize how lucky I was that I didn't get into any trouble. These days, I have D. who will support me unconditionally. She has a safety net and financial support from her parents in little ways. They wouldn't support me directly, but D. would and I guess you could say that's an inadvertent safety net.

I don't regret it because I definitely got opportunities and openings I don't believe I would have gotten otherwise. More than half of my costs were covered through scholarships and grants.

When I started traveling on my own dime, it also had the \"I Made It\" feeling. I do not have a financial safety net. My parents constantly remind me that were I ever to go broke or need any assistance that I'm always welcome to move back in with one of them. I was also in an incredibly violent relationship in which a good amount of my savings was stolen.

My father financially abused my mother, leaving us with incredible amounts of debt.", "Do you worry about money now?": "I worry about money now because of college. Before I started college, I wasn't worried. I had made great money at my jobs and saved tons. I wasn't prepared for how much college would cost and at first, it seemed like it wasn't worth the debt I would acquire. Eventually, I decided to stick to college and I am much less anxious now.

If yes, how did you pay for it?": "Absolutely. Neither of my parents has a four-year degree, and they cared deeply about me achieving more than they had the means to. I also had a knack for test-taking growing up, so my guidance counselors and teachers also always spoke with me about college aspirations. I attended an expensive public school for both my undergraduate and graduate degrees, fitting both into four years. Academic scholarships covered most of this. My total cost of tuition for the four years was about $80,000, which was all paid for. My student loans were taken out to cover my living costs, which I have mixed feelings about. I am proud to have earned my scholarships and gotten my degree, but I wish I would have known more about how much rent costs in a college town. I worked all four years (20 hours a week editing an academic journal), but this was basically enough to cover groceries and gas for my car.", "Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?": "In my household, money was looked at as a kind of necessary evil \u2014 having a job and making money was a way to allow us to do the things we really wanted to do, such as renovating a house or having boats or traveling. I did not receive an allowance, and my parents mostly educated me about finances through walking me through opening a savings account where I could put \u201cbirthday money\u201d and explaining how a Certificate of Deposit worked (my grandparents were big on those).

I got it for several reasons: I wanted an excuse to not mow our huge lawn in the summer, I love the water and it seemed better than bagging groceries or fast food, and all my friends were doing it too. I came back to it for the following summers in high school because someone (my boss) finally explained to me that I was pretty good at it, and that if I worked hard I could become a head lifeguard (I did), and that this would look great on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a way to show responsibility and leadership. She was right.", "Did you worry about money growing up?": "No. My family wasn't rich, but my parents were smart about having very little debt. I think they also insulated me from any worry \u2014 my dad lost his job in the 2008 financial crisis and I didn't even realize it until a couple of years ago.

Even though I don't make a lot of money, I know that I can cover my monthly expenses and I have a little saved to get me through unexpected issues.

My parents frequently couldn't afford groceries and were noticeably (even to me as a child) buried in debt. My siblings and I always worried about money \u2014 sometimes our friends' families would surreptitiously leave boxes of food on our doorstep or mail my parents checks. I always knew I'd be responsible for financing my own education and living expenses once I turned eighteen, and I've been doing so since then.", "Do you worry about money now?": "I do worry about money now, especially since the music and theater industries have really suffered from COVID-19 (and the fact that unlike large cultural organizations in Europe, American orchestras, operas, and theaters aren't state-funded). I'm not sure when I'll be able to make money from gigs again or teach music in a classroom safely, my two largest sources of income in normal times. I'm also concerned about further education budget cuts making my career path even less viable.

Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?": "My family never talked about money and told us we should never discuss it with our friends either. We were always told that we lived comfortably and that was all we needed to know. We were asked not to share with our friends that we had a college trust fund helping us with school. We didn't receive an allowance growing up, but we were also not allowed to get a job during high school. We were always told school is our job. We had money if we asked for it and could justify the cost to our parents. Now, I go to my brother when I want to discuss finances. He's always open with me about his income and savings. He makes more money than me, but I tend to put more into savings than him (% wise). Our parents will often let us know that they're here to help should we need anything and now tend to discuss our jobs, what we make, how much of a raise we should ask for, etc., but they don't talk about their own salaries.

I got a job working at the local McDonald's thanks to my brother. He worked the line in the mornings and put in a good word for me, so I ended up working the front counter and barista position. That same summer I also got a second job at a local pizza shop, as I had sent my resume out to all the local fast food joints in the area. I would often work the mornings at McDonald's and the afternoon/evenings at the pizza shop. My parents encouraged us to work during college breaks so we'd have spending money while at school. I didn't get my first salaried job until I graduated from college.", "Did you worry about money growing up?": "I did not worry about money growing up. We lived comfortably and never had to worry about bills. My brother and I didn't have our own cars, laptops/iPads, bedroom TVs, or anything like that that some of our friends had, but we never really wanted for anything.

I know I'm well off considering most of my friends are either living at home to save money and/or getting their postgraduate degrees and have a ton of student loan debt, but I often compare myself to my expectation on how well I should be doing. I wish I had more savings even though I know my friends are often living paycheck to paycheck. I know I'm financially sound to be able to start saving for retirement now, but I always think I should do more. I feel like I'm at the age where my family expects me to settle down soon.

My family had this expectation that I would graduate with a job waiting for me like my brother had, but I was a bit lost on what I wanted to do with my degree. I was working part-time at the pizza shop and part-time as an unpaid intern when I got hired at my current job. They took me on part-time as a paid intern. That lasted about two weeks before they decided they needed me to work full time. I was an intern for five months before I became a full-time employee and was put on a yearly salary. I moved out of my parent's place three months later and have been responsible for myself since. As for a financial safety net, my parents would step in if I ever lost my housing or income. I've been told I can always move back home and live with them rent-free should I need to. I don't believe they would help me financially outside of maybe one or two month's rent, but knowing I will never be homeless is definitely a weight off my shoulders.
